            <h2>Copyright</h2>
            <p>
              A copyright is a type of intellectual property that gives its
              owner the exclusive right to copy, distribute, adapt, display, and
              perform a creative work, usually for a limited time. Copyright is
              intended to protect the original expression of an idea in the form
              of a creative work, but not the idea itself.
            </p>

            ## Copyright Notice
            
            In the United States, the copyright notice consists of:

            - "©" or the word "Copyright" or abbreviation "Copr.";
            - the year of first publication of the copyrighted work; and
            - identification of the owner of the copyright, either by name, abbreviation, or other designation by which they are generally known.
            
            For example, for a work first published in 2011: © 2011 John Doe
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Bern Convention</h2>
            <p>
              Under the Berne Convention, which most countries have signed, an author automatically 
              obtains the exclusive copyright to anything they have written, and local law 
              may similarly grant copyright, patent, or trademark rights by default.

            ## Copyright License
            
            A copyright license gives a person or entity (“licensee") the authorization to use a work from the copyright owner, usually in exchange for payment. Copyright licenses may be exclusive or nonexclusive, and the rights that come with them vary according to the specifics of each license.

            />

            <p>
              A derivative work is an expressive creation that includes major
              copyrightable elements of an original, previously created first
              work (the underlying work).

            ## Public Domain

            The public domain consists of all the creative work to which no exclusive intellectual property rights apply.
            Those rights may have expired, been forfeited, expressly waived, or may be inapplicable.

            ## Public Domain License

            Public-domain-equivalent license are licenses that grant public-domain-like rights and/or act as waivers.
            They are used to make copyrighted works usable by anyone without conditions, while avoiding the complexities of attribution or license compatibility that occur with other licenses.

            ## CC BY - Attribution

            ![Logo](https://licensebuttons.net/l/by/3.0/88x31.png)

            This license lets others distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered. Recommended for maximum dissemination and use of licensed materials.

            ## CC BY-SA - Attribution-ShareAlike

            ![Logo](https://licensebuttons.net/l/by-sa/3.0/88x31.png)

            This license lets others remix, adapt, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and 
            license their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared to “copyleft” free and open source software licenses. 
            All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use. This is the license used by Wikipedia, 
            and is recommended for materials that would benefit from incorporating content from Wikipedia and similarly licensed projects.

            This license lets others remix, adapt, and build upon your work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge you and be non-commercial, they don’t have to license their derivative works on the same terms.

            ## Permissive Open Source Licenses 

            A permissive open source license is a non-copyleft open source license that guarantees the 
            freedom to use, modify, and redistribute, while also permitting proprietary derivative works.

            ## MIT License

            The MIT License, which bears the name of the famous university where it originated, is perhaps the most used 
            open source license in the world, perhaps because it is very short and clear and easy to understand. 
            It allows anyone to do whatever they wish with the original code, as long as the original copyright and license notice is 
            included either in the distributed source code or software. It removes any liability from authors 
            and does not explicitly contain a patent grant.

            ## Apache License

            The Apache License requires license notifications and copyrights on the distributed code and/or as a notice in the software. 
            However, derivative works, larger projects, or modifications are allowed to carry different licensing 
            terms when distributed and are not required to provide source code. Apache licenses contain a patent grant.

            ## BSD License

            License is another permissive open source license that preserves license notices and copyrights but allows larger or licensed works
            to be distributed without source code and under different license terms. 
            The 2- clause BSD License is very similar to the MIT open source license, while the 3-clause and 4-clause BSD licenses 
            add more requirements or restrictions related to reuse and other terms.

            ## Unlicense

            As its name indicates, this is the least restrictive of open source licenses because it amounts to making 
            the open source open to the public domain. No conditions apply, meaning these unlicensed works 
            can be distributed without source code and under different terms.

            ## Gratis versus Libre
            
            The English adjective free is commonly used in one of two meanings: "at no monetary cost" (gratis) and "with little or no restriction" (libre). 

            ![Free Beer](assets/Isummit_2008,_Japan,_free_beer_crop.png)

            Richard Stallman summarized the difference in a slogan: "Think free as in free speech, not free beer."

## Copyleft Software Licenses 

Copyleft is the legal technique of granting certain freedoms over copies of copyrighted works with the requirement that the same rights be preserved in derivative works.

            ## GPL
            
            The GNU General Public License (GPL) preserves license notifications and copyright terms and is suitable for commercial, patent, and private use. Any software that uses GPL code must distribute all its source code under the same license. So if you use GPL code in your software (e.g., by using a GPL library), and distribute your application, all your source code must be made available under the same GPL license. This restriction makes the GPL a strong copyleft license.

          <section data-markdown>
            ## LGPL

            LGPL is for library routines. If someone modifies your LGPL library code, the LGPL behaves pretty much like the GPL, but if someone writes software that merely uses your library, the LGPL doesn't impose source release on the program that calls upon your code. This can broaden the potential uses of a library.

            ## AGPL

            The Affero GPL (AGPL) only adds only one clause, but an important one for some software. Because the GPL license is only triggered when software is distributed, there is a loophole for software that is made available over the network only, i.e., not explicitly “distributed”. The AGPL license closes this loophole by including a remote network interaction clause that triggers the GPL license for any software used over a network.

            ## SSPL 

            The Server Side Public License (SSPL) - GPL + A company that offers a publicly available MongoDB as a service must release the software it uses to offer such service under the terms of the SSPL, including the management software, user interfaces, application program interfaces, automation software, monitoring software, backup software, storage software and hosting software, all such that a user could run an instance of the service using the source code made available.

            This license is now used for other well known products like ElasticSearch and Redis.

## Proprietary software licenses 

Provide no authority for code modification or reuse and normally provide software with operational code only, and no source code. A proprietary software license often includes terms that prohibit “reverse engineering” of the object code with the intention of obtaining source code by the licensee.

            ## Multi-licensing
            
            Multi-licensing is commonly done to support free software business models in a commercial environment. 
            In this scenario, one option is a proprietary software license, which allows the possibility of creating proprietary 
            applications derived from it, while the other license is a copyleft free software/open-source license, thus requiring 
            any derived work to be released under the same license.
